# Weight Tracker
Showcase full-featured iOS/Watch/OSX app for tracking weight loss progress.

### Why Weight Tracker?
This whole project is to showcase my iOS Development abilities. Obviously, the app is not a novel idea, and it was not meant to be. Weight Tracker is a simple app - I want the focus to be on the implementation.

### What is the goal?
I want to build a beautiful, full-featured app using a variety of tools and best practices.  I don't want to cut any corners on this one.
